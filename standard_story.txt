Profile: Shamiul Alom Sagor (Online nickname: Roger)

Background:
Shamiul Alom Sagor, known online as Roger, is a 30-year-old married man with a 3.5-year-old son. He has completed a diploma in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) and is planning to pursue a BSc in Computer Science. Sagor has intermediate-level skills in graphic design, particularly with Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. He also possesses beginner-level knowledge in cryptocurrency trading.

Crypto Journey:
In 2021, Sagor entered the crypto world as an investor. By 2022, he and two friends embarked on creating their own cryptocurrency token projects. Their team developed between 10 to 30 project ideas, some of which were successfully launched through stealth launches and presales.

Role and Responsibilities:
In these projects, Sagor primarily worked as a developer. He adapted and modified smart contract code from established EVM chain projects, customizing them for their own tokens. His responsibilities included deploying the ideas, creating social media presence, and gathering community support. One of his friends handled marketing, while the other managed social media and other operational aspects.

Project Success:
Their projects saw significant success, raising an estimated 200-300 BNB on the Binance Smart Chain, 70-90 ETH on the Ethereum chain, and approximately $10,000 on various other EVM-compatible chains. The team's earnings reached around $100,000 to $200,000 in one year through presale profits and token tax revenues.

Challenges and Mistakes:
Despite their initial success, the team faced challenges. As they achieved bigger wins, they began to neglect the ongoing work required for each project. Personal lives and the desire to enjoy their success led to reduced focus on their projects. This resulted in community demotivation and token price dumps.

Project Closure:
Recognizing their inability to maintain the projects, the team decided to announce the cessation of future development for all their projects. They set specific dates for each project's closure, after which they removed liquidity and shut down operations. The funds were divided among team members, effectively ending their collaborative efforts.

Current Situation:
After a hiatus of over a year, Sagor and his team are considering restarting their crypto business, either individually or as a group. They recognize that their previous approach is no longer viable and that they lack the skills for traditional offline businesses.

Self-Reflection:
Sagor acknowledges his mistake in not focusing on personal skill development during their period of success. He now realizes the importance of continuous learning and specializing in specific areas for long-term career sustainability.

Future Aspirations:
Despite past setbacks, Sagor remains determined to succeed. He's interested in learning and developing expertise in areas that can secure his future. He has a particular interest in coding and web3 development, stemming from his CSE background.

Financial Needs:
With family responsibilities, Sagor requires a minimum monthly income of around $400 USD to cover personal and family expenses.

Skills and Interests:
- Intermediate graphic design skills (Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator)
- Basic knowledge of crypto trading and token creation
- Beginner-level skills in various coding languages
- Interest in YouTube content creation (non-vlogging)
- Experience with subscription-based business models
- Desire to create passive income streams

Seeking Guidance:
Sagor is now looking for advice on how to leverage his experiences and interests to build a sustainable career path. He's open to ideas that combine his technical skills, crypto knowledge, and content creation interests while providing for his family's needs.
